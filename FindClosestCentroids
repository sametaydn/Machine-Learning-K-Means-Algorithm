function idx = findClosestCentroids(X, centroids)

K = size(centroids, 1);

% You need to return the following variables correctly.
idx = zeros(size(X,1), 1);


%               Go over every example, find its closest centroid, and store
%               the index inside idx at the appropriate location.
%               Concretely, idx(i) should contain the index of the centroid
%               closest to example i. Hence, it should be a value in the 
%               range 1..K


m = size(X,1);
for i = 1:m,
  minDistance = 10^6; % randomly chosen large enough value 
  for j = 1:K,
    distance = sum((X(i,:) - centroids(j,:)).^2);
    if distance < minDistance,
      minDistance = distance;
      idx(i) = j;
    end
  end
end
